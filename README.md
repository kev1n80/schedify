# schedify
Schedify was created in order to bring people together by simplifying planning though shared schedules.
This is a final week Google CSSI project created by the Numerals.
The numerals include Leah Attai, Kevin Cam, and Michael Kelly.

Leah Attai created the home page functionality, integrated the Google calendar API, and the "compare with connections" functionality which allows users to compare their calendars with their friends. Furthermore, when comparing calendars the user's events are hidden for privacy reasons.

Kevin Cam integrated the Google users and ndb API, created the main.py file which connects all the handlers, created the models.py file and all the entities within it, added jinja coding to all the files except for the home.html or scehdule.html, created the functionality within the events, connections, and profile pages as well as the subpages within those pages, and ...

Michael Kelly added images, created all the css and js files, and designed the website.
